We all learn new skills everyday, but making something out of that is the most happiest thing and making into a product gives us much more happiness and motivation to create more things.

But, do you all know how I made this and what's behind the seen of this application?

Hi, my name is Akhil pursuing Btech in Electronics and Computer Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus Kollam.

## Idea!

The Idea behind this application is quite simple, since I'm a YouTuber I have a large community of people who are in search of jobs. So, the problem is that going through every notification and reading through 8 - 10 pages sounds very hard. As a results I figured out various things they wanted to know in order to submitting an application for a Job.

## Technologies I used to build the product

1. Python-Django for Backend.
2. React-JS for frontend (WebApp)
3. React-Native for Mobile Application
4. GraphQL for API

## Open Source?

Since, I'm a Open Source enthusiast soon I will make the project visible to the whole world, and we will build together.
